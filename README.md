# Python_Tutorial
A beginner's tutorial on Python and common Data Science related Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib. This was done in collaboration with a teammate for CECS 553. 
There are 12 modules in the tutorial, starting from the installation of Python to plotting graphs using Matplotlib. 
Modules 7-12 were authored by me. This is an original work created to help students who are new to coding to understand and practice Python for their coursework.
